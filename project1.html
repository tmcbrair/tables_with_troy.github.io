									<h1>Milwaukee Crime Statistics Project</h1>
									<p>A few weeks ago I was having a discussion with some friends about how it feels like Milwaukee is becoming more unsafe compared to when we used to live in the city back in 2013. Being the curious person that I am, I wanted to find 
										if this statement is true or false using a combination of SQL, Python, Excel, and Tableau.
									</p>
								</header>
								<div class="image main"><img src="images/pic01.jpg" alt="" /></div>
								<p>The first step in this journey is to find our datasets. Lucky for me, Milwaukee has some amazing datasets for public use. Much of the data does have an API that could have been utilized, however at the time when this project was done, I did not have the skillset
									to use that API natively within Jupyter. </p>
								
								<p><a href="https://data.milwaukee.gov/dataset/wibrarchive/resource/395db729-a30a-4e53-ab66-faeb5e1899c8">Historical dataset(2005-2022)</a></p>
								<p><a href="https://data.milwaukee.gov/dataset/wibr/resource/87843297-a6fa-46d4-ba5d-cb342fb2d3bb">Current dataset(2023~)</a></p>
								

								<p> 
									Now that we have our data, it's time to explore and clean! Opening both datasets within Excel first since they would both need to be converted to Excel format for better integration with SQL Server anyways. I reviewed and found that IncidentNum does vary
									between INT and String. This is due to the way in which the Milwaukee Police Department started the "P2C" program in October 2022, which allows for citizens to self report crimes without police taking the formal incident. Those incidents that were reported
									by the citizens begins with P2C.
								</p>
								<p>
									Since the "incidentnum" is the column that will be used to tie together all of the data later on, I made sure that we were void of nulls and blanks.</p>
								</p>
								<p>
									To simplify things, I chose to merge the current dataset with the historical dataset. From there, I extracted the [IncidentNum, roughX, roughY] from the merged dataset into a new excel document since I wanted to keep the output 
									separate that of the main dataset. The reason being is that I am going to use Python to convert
									the RoughX and RoughY coordinates into a format that can be used by Tableau. From within Tableau and SQL Server, joining the transformed coordinate data to the incidentnum on the main dataset can be done easily now.
